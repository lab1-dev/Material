# Lab1 Material
Material Design Components for Typescript. 

This NPM package provides the Material Design components for use with [Lab1 Core](https://github.com/lab1-dev/Core). It is in early stages with some components developed and uses the same open source license used by Lab1 Core. Many components share files used by the excellent project [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/), so the [MIT](https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/blob/dev/LICENSE) license used by them also applies to this project. 

This project is intended to provide intuitive tools that allow creativity to flow unobstructed to create products that are truly pro-life and pro-human and all contributions are welcome. If you or the company you work for aligns with the principles of this project, please consider helping to develop or support it financially.

[Lab1 website](https://lab1.dev/) contains the documentation and sample codes illustrating the usage with core components and material design components. You can use the components in 3 ways: [Typescript](https://github.com/lab1-dev/Core#typescript), [Managed Typescript](https://github.com/lab1-dev/Core#managed-typescript) e [Managed TSX](https://github.com/lab1-dev/Core#managed-tsx). 

**This project is not ready for production and your contribution makes a difference!**
